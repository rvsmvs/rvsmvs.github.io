# Unmasking Ransomware - A Deep Dive into Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence

Minimal GitHub Pages site using **jekyll-theme-minimal** for a school project on ransomware reversing.

## Quick publish
1) Create a public repo (user site: `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`, or project site: any name).  
2) Upload these files to the repo root and commit.  
3) **Settings → Pages** → Source: *Deploy from a branch*, Branch: *main* / *(root)*.  
4) Set `_config.yml` `url` and `baseurl` after it's live.

## Add a write-up
Create a file under `writeups/` with this header:
```yaml
---
layout: default
title: "Lab: NAME"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: ["static","dynamic","ioc"]
---
```
