## Ethics & Safety

- **Purpose**: Defensive research and education only.  
- **No weaponization**: Do not build, modify, or distribute malware.  
- **Safe environment**: Analyze samples only in **isolated VMs** without host shares; keep networking disabled or restricted (user-mode NAT) as required by your institution.  
- **Legal compliance**: Follow school policy, platform ToS, and applicable laws.  
- **Data handling**: Do not upload live samples to public repos. Use hashes (e.g., SHA256) and redacted screenshots instead.  
- **Disclosure**: If research uncovers live infrastructure or exposed keys, follow responsible disclosure practices with your instructor's guidance.
