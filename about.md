## About this project

This site documents a school project exploring **ransomware reversing** and **threat intelligence**. The goal is to practice safe, ethical analysis techniques, extract indicators of compromise (IOCs), and communicate findings clearly.

**Scope** (non-exhaustive):
- Lab setup (isolation, snapshots, tooling)
- Static & dynamic triage
- Configuration and key artifacts collection
- Network & persistence behaviors
- YARA/Sigma rules (defensive only)
- Reporting and visualization
